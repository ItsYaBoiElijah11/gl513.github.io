## Hey! I'm GL.
* I am an amateur web developer, application tester, theme maker, and more.
* I'm a huge android enthusiast and hacker, and hope to be a real android OS developer one day! :)
* One of the applications I am currently testing is [KeyMapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.sds100.keymapper&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1) by [sds100](https://github.com/sds100/). I would be glad to test your application too!
* You can contact me at my Google Voice number at (304)-506-8871â€¬ and the [KeyMapper Discord](http://keymapper.club/)!
* Thanks for visiting!
